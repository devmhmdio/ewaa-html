                        <p>Ewaa is here today because of the seeds of hope planted by Her Highness Sheikha Fatima, the ‘Mother of the Nation’, and nurtured by the vision of the late Sheikh Zayed, the founding father of the UAE. Sheikh Zayed spoke about the
                            importance of the human right to dignity. Every day this spirit guides the work we do.</p>
                        <p>We started as the nonprofit Ewaa Shelter for Women and Children, and today we are the <strong>Abu Dhabi Center for Sheltering and Humanitarian Care –
                          Ewaa,</strong> a social sector government entity.</p>
                        <p>From handling cases of human trafficking since 2008 to handling all forms of violence from 2020, we have grown into thriving trees that spread their shade over those in need.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, we have nurtured what we, at Ewaa, refer to as our 360° Model of Care. We work directly with the people who carry the burden of violence so they can heal and rejoin society. We support national efforts towards violence
                            prevention, and advocate for policy-level changes so we can tackle violence more effectively.</p>
                        <p>As we grow, our shade continues to provide respite to more and more vulnerable people – women, men, children, from our Emirati and expat communities in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of all of us at Ewaa, I encourage you to do your part. Join us to plant more seeds of awareness and break this cycle of violence in our society.

                        <p>Her Excellency Sarah Ibrahim Shuhail is the Director-General of the Abu Dhabi Center for Shelter and Humanitarian Care - Ewaa, an affiliate of the Department of Community Development.</p>
                        <p>HE Sarah has led Ewaa since its establishment in 2008. Ewaa’s scope of work has expanded significantly under her leadership, especially in 2020, when the Executive Council of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi granted it more responsibilities
                            and powers.</p>
                        <p>The decision was a result of Ewaa’s successes and its role in providing services to hundreds of victims, solving their cases, rehabilitating them, and enabling them to effectively return to society. </p>
                        <p>Ewaa has now moved beyond sheltering people who are victims of human trafficking to include care, rehabilitation, and empowerment of various cases of violence.
                        </p>
                        <p>HE Sarah plays an active role in developing policies and laws related to the upholding of human rights. She is a member of several relevant committees, including:

                        </ul>
                        <p>HE Sarah has won several awards in recognition of her efforts, including the Petrochem GR8 Women Awards (2012) for work in the humanitarian field, and the Most Inspirational Woman (2012) at the L'Officiel Arab Woman Awards for
                            her achievements in rehabilitating victims of human trafficking. She has also been featured on the list of the most powerful Arab women in the magazine ‘Arabian Business’, and in CEO Magazine as one of the 100 most powerful
                            Arab women.</p>
                        <p>HE Sarah’s early career was dedicated to building and developing people. A former educator with more than 31 years of experience in the country, she has worked as a teacher in schools in Abu Dhabi. She went on to become a director
                            of various schools in the emirate, and an educational consultant.</p>
                        <p>HE Sarah holds a diploma in school administration from the United Arab Emirates University, and a diploma in combating human trafficking from the Dubai Judicial Institute. She has also been certified as an ‘expert’ in the field
